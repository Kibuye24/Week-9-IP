# # Models Predicting Survival in the Titanic and Spam Emails
### Python Programmming Data Science Project, February, 2022
#### By **Kibuye**
## Description
This week's project requires us to implement a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier  and a Naive Bayes classifier. Once we conduct the experiments, we will calculate the resulting metrics:

Experimental Procedure:
* Download the two datasets from the given links:
* Dataset 1 Source: [Train Dataset Source: Link (Links to an external site.), Test Dataset Source: Link (Links to an external site.)]
  Dataset 2 Source: [Link (Links to an external site.)]
* Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20  sets.
* For dataset 1, because we don't have the label for the test set, we will use the train set to create train and test data (i.e. splitting further), then perform K-nearest neighbor classification.
* For dataset 2, perform classification of the testing set samples using the Naive Bayes Classifier.
* Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).
* Report the confusion matrix of each classifier.
* Repeat step 2 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.
* Suggest and apply at least one of the optimization techniques that you learned earlier this week.
* Provide further recommendations to improve both classifiers.
## Research Question:
Build a model that determines whether or not an email is spam or whether a person is likely to survive the titanic.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook.
* Pandas and Numpy Python libraries for data exploration and manipulation
* Data cleaning tools
* Exploratory data analysis techniques.
* Machine Learning
